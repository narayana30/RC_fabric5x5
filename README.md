# FPGA-Based RC Fabric (5x5 Architecture)
Overview:\
Designed and implemented a 5x5 RC Fabric using Xilinx Vivado to demonstrate proficiency in FPGA design and synthesis with VHDL.

Key Features:\
25 Compute Units (CUs) optimized for performance and resource utilization.
Sequential logic for seamless data flow between CU rows.
Multiplexer (MUX)-based mirroring for efficient data transfer and minimal latency.
VHDL-based implementation ensuring robust functionality.
Comprehensive testing & validation using VHDL test benches, RTL analysis, and waveform simulations.

Tools & Technologies:\
Xilinx Vivado for design & synthesis.
VHDL for hardware description.
RTL schematics & waveform simulations for validation.
